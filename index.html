      <p>Every outcast has his own personality and moral code. In Kaila, instead of just choosing different dialogue options, you will choose the character who will respond. Each personality will be developed according to how you let them act and which quest lines you get involved with, to shape not only the main story but every character's path.</p>
      <p>Play to every outcast's strengths. Every character has his own playstyle and will be able to be customized based on their equipment and training. Will you exploit their strenghts, or address their weaknesses? It's up to you to make the most of their abilities, and to remember that every hand is welcome when it is for survival's sake. Is it?</p>

            <h1>Avath</h1>
            <p>Born in the slums of Capital City, raised on the streets. His childhood taught him early enough about how twisted and unhinged a human can be. Some say he used to be an assassin, working for the continent's main government, before he ran away. Nowadays, his profession is mostly as a caravan guard, and though he's slim, he's demonstrated he can manage himself quite good.</p>
            <p>Mostly introverted and reserved, he's known to be a man of a few words, and just the necessary action. This is precisely what causes some men to fear him.</p>

            <h1>Bersic</h1>
            <p>The eldest son of a humble but honor-bound family. Bersic ran away from the continent for yet unknown reasons, and since then he's served as a ranger to the surroundings of the city. Proficient mostly in combat, he carries the sword of his defunct family. Not a very well known one, but one he nevertheless represents proudly.</p>
            <p>Bersic is known to be extremely wary and suspicious about the people of Kaila, as a lot of them were criminals before arriving the city. He claims to be honor-bound, and morally unbreakable.</p>

            <h1>Maelvar</h1>
            <p>Heretic, sorcerer, profane. Those were the words that would've described Maelvar before escaping to Kaila, as his arms are covered by forbidden runes. Nobody can grasp for certain if they can even grant him unnatural powers, but they surely hope they won't. Leaving behind a mysterious past, he was until the outbreak one of the best mercenaries on Kaila, dedicating himself to be as a dangerous a fighter can be.</p>
            <p>Some would describe him as arrogant, and a little bit bitter. Unfriendly, and with a temperament at those who defy him.</p>

            <p>He used to be a warrior of The Order, before being sentenced to death for killing one of his brothers in arms. Since then, he managed to escape and settle in Kaila. It is said he claimed a huge bounty which allowed him to buy a land close enough to the city, and since then he's been a farmer, visiting from time to time the town.</p>
            <p>Sean is known to be somewhat unpleasant, prone to making sick jokes and having a dense attitude. He's also known to be very stubborn, and some even say he's into religion, a practice once banned in the main continent, who just a few practice.</p>
