                        <p>This blog will serve as a way of portraying the principles on which the game is developed, exploring the foundations upon every decision is made, and discussing the way games are developed overall.</p>
                        <p>As most indie development initiatives, we intend to make the game within the scope of what we sense is right, and thus, we make our own workflow which may or not deviate to those of others.</p>
                        <p>The first topic we will address is one lying at the very core of our game; the decision to make a party based game. In a sense, this question takes us back to the beginning of the western RPG videogame genre, as it's own foundation is tied to the pen and paper roleplaying games, consisting mostly on a social activity involving a group. We could also date the sense of party to the early medieval fantasy literature works, just to have an insight of how ancient this topic might be. Whatever the cause, it's development and evolution has taken many forms throughout the decades, from scripted companions with a complex background, to fully customized characters, or to be entirely disposed of. The later normally take the form of the player output, and it is a full expression of the ability to choose the way of play. I believe this constitues more of a puzzling question to the player, inviting to strategize involving strenghts and weaknesses. It's narrative use is more tricky, as it involves characters made fully out of their archetypes, but where there's obstacles there's also an invitation for clever solutions. Icewind Dale forces the player to take moral solutions around of their paladins in some cases, for example, forcing a decision which might have been tactical, to have repercussions in the narrative.</p>
                        <p>But as a fan of character studies, it is the complex psychological themes that gather most of my attention. To fully flesh out a character and make a compelling use of the medium is a rather  challenging task, and while a lot of RPGs offer relatable companions, most do so while offering obvious development, or at the expense of a more complex relationship with the player. I believe this last part to be the price of trying to offer the experience of fully customize a character and also provide the ability to have an impact in the narrative, more specifically in your companion's stories. A white canvas can only offer a couple of bland personalities, and those can hardly have a complex development, instead its depth is just enough to make sense.</p>
                        <p>Not wanting to criticize, I believe those games showed us the possibilities games have to construct stories, and without them we wouldn't have the chance to make those opinions. It is addressing that very opinion we decided for Kaila to be a party based game, where the player, instead of having the ability to make their own character, is forced to make his decisions through the personalities of a fixed group. We try to compensate the lack of customization with the ability to explore these fully fleshed characters, and we have made the effort of writing them as best as we can, presenting with each one a different approach to every problem, technical or moral.</p>
